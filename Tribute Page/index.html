                            Who was Stravinsky?
                        </h3>
                        <p class="paragraph margin-bottom-small">
                           <strong> Igor Fyodorovich Stravinsky</strong>  was a Russian-born composer, pianist, and conductor. 
                           He is widely considered one of the most important and influential composers of the 20th century. 

                        </p>
                        <p class="paragraph margin-bottom-small">
                            Stravinsky's compositional career was notable for its stylistic diversity. He first achieved international fame with three ballets commissioned by the impresario Serge Diaghilev 
                            and first performed in Paris by Diaghilev's Ballets Russes: <strong>Firebird (1910), Petrushka (1911), and The Rite of Spring (1913).</strong>  The latter transformed the way in which 
                            subsequent composers thought about rhythmic structure and was largely responsible for Stravinsky's enduring reputation as a musical revolutionary who pushed the boundaries of musical design.
                        </p>
                        <p class="paragraph margin-bottom-small">
                            His "Russian phase", which continued with works such as <i>Renard, L'Histoire du soldat</i>, and <i>Les noces</i>, was followed in the 1920s by a period in which he turned to neoclassicism. 
                            The works from this period tended to make use of traditional musical forms (concerto grosso, fugue, and symphony) and drew from earlier styles, especially those of the 18th century. In the 1950s, 
                            Stravinsky adopted serial procedures. His compositions of this period shared traits with examples of his earlier output: rhythmic energy, the construction of extended melodic ideas out of a few two- 
                            or three-note cells, and clarity of form and instrumentation.
                        </p>
                        <p class="paragraph margin-bottom-small">
                            If Stravinsky's stated intention was "to send them all to hell", then he may have regarded the 1913 premiere of The Rite of Spring as a success: it resulted in one of history's most famous classical 
                            music riots, and Stravinsky referred to it on several occasions in his autobiography as a scandale. There were reports of fistfights in the audience and the need for a police presence during the second act.
                            The real extent of the tumult is open to debate and the reports may be apocryphal.           
                        </p>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            In 1998, Time magazine named Stravinsky as one of the 100 most influential people of the century.[146] In addition to the recognition he received for his compositions, he achieved fame as a pianist and a conductor, often at the premieres of his works.

                           Early life
                        </h3>
                        <p class="paragraph margin-bottom-small">
                            Stravinsky was born on 17 June 1882 in the town of Oranienbaum on the southern coast of the Gulf of Finland, 25 miles west of Saint Petersburg.
                             His father, Fyodor Ignatievich Stravinsky (1843–1902), was an established bass opera singer in the Kyiv Opera and the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg 
                             and his mother, Anna Kirillovna Stravinskaya (née Kholodovskaya; 1854–1939), a native of Kyiv, was one of four daughters of a high-ranking official in the 
                             Kyiv Ministry of Estates.
                        </p>
                        <p class="paragraph margin-bottom-small">
                            Stravinsky took to music at an early age and began regular piano lessons at age nine, followed by tuition in music theory and composition. At around eight years old, 
                            he attended a performance of Tchaikovsky's ballet The Sleeping Beauty at the Mariinsky Theatre, which began a lifelong interest in ballets and the composer himself. 
                            By age fifteen, Stravinsky had mastered Mendelssohn's Piano Concerto No. 1 and finished a piano reduction of a string quartet by Alexander Glazunov, who reportedly 
                            considered Stravinsky unmusical and thought little of his skills.[

                            Death
                         </h3>
                         <p class="paragraph margin-bottom-small">
                            On 18 March 1971, Stravinsky was taken to Lenox Hill Hospital with pulmonary edema where he stayed for ten days. On 29 March, he moved into a newly furbished apartment at 920 Fifth Avenue, 
                            his first city apartment since living in Paris in 1939. After a period of well being, the edema returned on 4 April and Vera insisted that medical equipment should be installed in the apartment.
                            Stravinsky soon stopped eating and drinking and died at 5:20 a.m. on 6 April at the age of 88. The cause on his death certificate is heart failure. A funeral service was held three days later at 
                            Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel. As per his wishes, he was buried in the Russian corner of the cemetery island of San Michele in northern Italy, several yards from the tomb of Sergei Diaghilev.
                            He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and in 1987 he was posthumously awarded the Grammy Award for Lifetime Achievement. He was posthumously inducted into the National Museum of Dance and 
                            Hall of Fame in 2004.

                            <strong>Part I: the adoration of the earth:</strong> The curtain rises to reveal young men and women in separate groups. Their surroundings are primitive and dominated by the dark forces of nature.
                             At first the dances are light hearted but they slowly change to have more aggressive and savage movements. The young men take possession of the women and carry them offstage. A fight ensues until 
                             a wise old man makes peace. There is a stunned silence, then the men throw themselves on the ground in worship, rise again, and start an even more frenzied dance. <strong>Part II: the sacrifice</strong>
                             The young women are standing on the stage near a fire, one of them will be chosen as a sacrifice to the earth. The chosen one stands alone and still in the middle of the stage after a mystic dance, 
                             and the young members of the tribe gather around her and dance in a "crescendo or brutal excitement." Finally the chosen one joins them and the dancing grows more and more violent until it 
                             climaxes and the chosen maiden falls exhausted and dies. The men then carry her over to the sacred stone and fall prostrate. The rite is over.

                            Lawrence Morton, in a study of the origins of The Rite, records that in 1907–08 Stravinsky set to music two poems from Sergey Gorodetsky's collection Yar. Another poem in the anthology, 
                            which Stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read, is "Yarila" which, Morton observes, contains many of the basic elements from which The Rite of Spring developed, including pagan rites,
                             sage elders, and the propitiatory sacrifice of a young maiden: "The likeness is too close to be coincidental".<strong>Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of The Rite.</strong> 
                             In a 1920 article <i>he stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music rather than the other way round.</i> However, in his 1936 
                             autobiography he described the origin of the work thus:<i>"One day [in 1910], when I was finishing the last pages of L'Oiseau de Feu in Saint Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision ... I saw in my 
                            imagination a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps".</i>

                            Stravinsky's sketchbooks show that after returning to his home at Ustilug in Ukraine in September 1911, he worked on two movements, the "Augurs of Spring" and the "Spring Rounds". In October he left Ustilug for Clarens in 
                            Switzerland, where in a tiny and sparsely-furnished room—an 2.4 by 2.4 m closet, with only a muted upright piano, a table and two chairs —he worked throughout the 1911–12 winter on the score.
                            By March 1912, according to the sketchbook chronology, Stravinsky had completed Part I and had drafted much of Part II. He also prepared a two-hand piano version, subsequently lost.

                            The Riot

                            Premiere
                         </h4>

                            On the evening of 29 May, Gustav Linor reported, "Never ... has the hall been so full, or so resplendent; the stairways and the corridors were crowded with spectators eager 
                            to see and to hear". The evening began with Les Sylphides, The Rite followed. Some eyewitnesses and commentators said that the disturbances in the audience began during the Introduction, 
                            and grew noisier when the curtain rose on the stamping dancers in "Augurs of Spring". But music historian Richard Taruskin asserts, "it was not Stravinsky's music that did the shocking. 
                            It was the ugly earthbound lurching and stomping devised by Vaslav Nijinsky." Marie Rambert, who was working as an assistant to Nijinsky, recalled later that it was soon impossible to hear 
                            the music on the stage. In his autobiography,<strong> Stravinsky writes that the derisive laughter that greeted the first bars of the Introduction disgusted him</strong>, and that he left 
                            the auditorium to watch the rest of the performance from the stage wings. demonstrations, he says, 
                            grew into <strong>"a terrific uproar"</strong> which, along with the on-stage noises, drowned out the voice of Nijinsky who was shouting the step numbers to the dancers.                         
                        </p>
                         <p class="paragraph margin-bottom-small">
                            At that time, a Parisian ballet audience typically consisted of two diverse groups: the wealthy and fashionable set, who would be expecting to see a traditional performance with beautiful music, 
                            and a "Bohemian" group who, the poet-philosopher Jean Cocteau asserted, would "acclaim, right or wrong, anything that is new because of their hatred of the boxes". Monteux believed that<strong> the 
                            trouble began when the two factions began attacking each other</strong>, but their mutual anger was soon diverted towards the orchestra:<strong> "Everything available was tossed in our direction, but we continued to play on"</strong>. 
                            Around forty of the worst offenders were ejected—possibly with the intervention of the police, although this is uncorroborated. Through all the disturbances the performance continued without interruption. The unrest receded significantly 
                            during Part II, and by some accounts Maria Piltz's rendering of the final "Sacrificial Dance" was watched in reasonable silence. At the end there were several curtain calls for the dancers, for Monteux and the orchestra, and for Stravinsky 
                            and Nijinsky before the evening's programme continued.
                         </p>
                         <p class="paragraph">
                            Among the more hostile press reviews was that of Le Figaro's critic, Henri Quittard, who called the work <strong>"a laborious and puerile barbarity"</strong> and added<i> "We are sorry to see an artist such as M. Stravinsky involve himself in this disconcerting adventure"</i>.
                            On the other hand, Gustav Linor, writing in the leading theatrical magazine Comoedia, thought the performance was superb, especially that of Maria Piltz; the disturbances, while deplorable, were merely "a rowdy debate" between two ill-mannered factions.
                            Emile Raudin, of Les Marges, who had barely heard the music, wrote:<i> "Couldn't we ask M. Astruc ... to set aside one performance for well-intentioned spectators? ... We could at least propose to evict the female element".</i>

                              The Firebird (French: L'Oiseau de feu; Russian: Жар-птица, romanized: Zhar-ptitsa) is a ballet and orchestral concert work by the Russian-born composer Igor Stravinsky. It was written for the 1910 Paris season of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company. The original choreography was by Michel Fokine, who collaborated with Alexandre Benois on a scenario based on the Russian fairy tales of the Firebird and the blessing and curse it possesses for its owner. Its premiere at the Opéra de Paris on 25 June 1910 was an immediate success, catapulting Stravinsky to international fame.

                              The ballet was not only Stravinsky's professional breakthrough, but also the beginning of his partnership with Diaghilev, which would subsequently produce Petrushka, The Rite of Spring, Pulcinella, Mavra, and Les noces.

                                Petrushka (French: Pétrouchka; Russian: Петрушка) is a ballet and orchestral concert work by Russian composer Igor Stravinsky. It was written for the 1911 Paris season of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company; the original choreography was by Michel Fokine and stage designs and costumes by Alexandre Benois, who assisted Stravinsky with the libretto. The ballet premiered at the Théâtre du Châtelet on 13 June 1911 with Vaslav Nijinsky as Petrushka, Tamara Karsavina as the lead ballerina, Alexander Orlov as the Moor, and Enrico Cecchetti the charlatan.

                                Petrushka tells the story of the loves and jealousies of three puppets. The three are brought to life by the Charlatan during the 1830 Shrovetide Fair (Maslenitsa) in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Petrushka loves the Ballerina, but she rejects him. She prefers the Moor. Petrushka is angry and hurt, and challenges the Moor. The Moor kills him with his scimitar. Petrushka's ghost rises above the puppet theatre as night falls. He shakes his fist at the Charlatan, then collapses in a second death.

                                Petrushka brings music, dance, and design together in a unified whole. It is one of the most popular of the Ballets Russes productions. It is usually performed today using the original designs and choreography. Grace Robert wrote in 1946, "Although more than thirty years have elapsed since Petrushka was first performed, its position as one of the greatest ballets remains unassailed. Its perfect fusion of music, choreography, and décor and its theme—the timeless tragedy of the human spirit—unite to make its appeal universal".

                             Agon (1957) is a 22-minute neoclassical ballet for twelve dancers with music by Igor Stravinsky. Its first choreographer was George Balanchine. Stravinsky began composition in December 1953 but was interrupted the next year; he resumed work in 1956 and concluded on April 27, 1957. The music was first performed on June 17, 1957, in Los Angeles conducted by Robert Craft, while the first stage performance was given by the New York City Ballet on December 1, 1957, at the City Center of Music and Drama, New York (White 1979, 490). Between those dates the Südwestfunk in Germany made the work's first studio recording; the Sinfonieorchester des Südwestfunks Baden-Baden, as it was then called, was led by Hans Rosbaud. This was released on the Wergo label seven years later and remains in the catalog, for sale online from Amazon.de (Anon. & n.d.(b)).

                                The composition's long gestation period covers an interesting juncture in Stravinsky's composing career, in which he moved from a diatonic musical idiom to one based on twelve-tone technique; the music of the ballet thus demonstrates a unique symbiosis of musical idioms. The ballet has no story, but consists of a series of dance movements in which various groups of dancers interact in pairs, trios, quartets, etc. A number of the movements are based on 17th-century French court dances – saraband, galliard and bransle. It was danced as part of City Ballet's 1982 Stravinsky Centennial Celebration.
